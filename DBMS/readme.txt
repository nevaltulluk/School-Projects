# Storage System manager

This is a terminal application that you can run using the terminal of any java IDE.
 
 In this project I did the implementation of the database storage manager that I designed earlier. With this terminal program, user can do some DLL and DML operations which are create a type, delete a type, list all types, create a record, delete a record, search for a record and list all records of a type.  
 I made the implementation with java. Every structure except system catalogue has its own class for initialization.  System catalogue is initialized in Main class and the DLL and DML operations are implemented in Main class as well. I used some side functions to make the code simpler, they are usually for type conversions such as from byte array to string or to integer.
